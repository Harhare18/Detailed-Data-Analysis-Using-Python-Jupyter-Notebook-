# Detailed-Data-Analysis-Using-Python-in-Jupyter-Notebook-

OBJECTIVE: We will build a classifier to predict the Pass/Fail yield of a particular process entity and analyse whether all the features are required to build the model or not.

Implemented various python libraries for detailed data analysis in jupyter notebook to analyze signal data.
Applied various steps like data exploration, cleaning, visualization, Data pre-processing.
Carried with model training, testing and tuning with cross validation techninque to deciced best suited model for the dataset.
finally conclude with the Random Forest Classifier Model with 0.99 accuracy rate.
